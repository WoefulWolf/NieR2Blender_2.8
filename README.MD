# THIS HAS BEEN REPLACED AND WON'T BE UPDATED ANYMORE

This fork is being updated by **Woeful_Wolf** in an attempt to keep Nier2Blender alive for Blender 2.8 and future versions. <br>

<br>

Materials/textures have been redone completely due to the new Blender 2.8+ rendering engines updates. <br>
This means it now has **Eevee/Cycles material import support for the Principled Shader! PBR Yay!** <br>

<br>

This is still a bit WIP so reporting any bugs would be appreciated, I could not test with every model in the game but if you find any that are problematic, be sure to include what model it was (helps with debugging). <br>

(And thanks for helping with testing; Kekoulis)

If you use my tool and release something, please give appropriate credit and info. I would really love for my tools to become more 
widely known so that others can start modding too. :)

## What have I added exactly?

* Blender 2.8+ Support
* Importing to Eevee/Cycles
* Alpha Channel Support
* MaskMap Support
* LightMap Support
* Multiple Normal Map Support
* Importing straight from .DTT files directly (skips manual extraction)
* (and probably some other small things I've forgotten)
